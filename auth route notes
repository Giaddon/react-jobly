"Auth route"

Certain components need to have user data (and know if you're logged in).
 - Profile
 - JobCard

 Right now we have a context that tracks both, set on the app. 

 app
   routes
      everything else

app
   routes
      authorized < props v context? 
         authorized components
         public components 



Auth
  function to update user

  state: user
  


Profile
  return form
  state = content of the form
  prop = function to update user
