# Jobly
This app began as a project for Rithm School, which I have expanded on since graduation.

Jobly is a full stack job board app made in Node. The front end is a single page in React, using React Router to dynamically mount and unmount components, and the back end is Express with a Postgres database (you can see that here: https://github.com/Giaddon/jobly-backend/).

Rithm School instructors provided the data to seed the database and some of the configuration files, and the app framework was initialized with create react app.

The app allows users to login or create a user profile, then browse a selection of jobs or companies. Jobs can be "applied" for by clicking the apply button. There is a database search that will filter jobs or companies (depending on the page).

You can try it yourself at https://jobly-gtrail.herokuapp.com/. Use username: test and password: password.
