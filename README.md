# Jobly
This app began as a project for Rithm School, which I have expanded on since graduation.

Jobly is a full stack job board app made in Node. The front end is a single page in React, using React Router to dynamically mount and unmount components, and the back end is Express with a Postgres database (you can see that here: https://github.com/Giaddon/jobly-backend/).

Rithm School instructors provided the data to seed the database and some of the configuration files. 

You can try it yourself at https://jobly-gtrail.herokuapp.com/. Use username: test and password: password.
